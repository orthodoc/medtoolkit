It's a *chaotic world* out there. And you have innumerable tasks to finish as you start your day. Do you rush to begin one as you finish the other? Do you start wondering about the previous task as you get onto the next one? No wonder so many of us feel *rushed* through the day.

A day has only 24 hours. Not more. Not less. And that restricts the time we can allot to a particular task. Though this may sound obvious --- there is a time constraint on each task. No matter how good you are at multi-tasking, this is an irrefutable fact. You have to respect it. If you do that, then it leaves us with two situations. You have the choice of performing many tasks allotting each one a small amount of time or a few tasks with sufficient time for every single one of them. Most often we end up choosing the former. And why do we do that? Somehow, it has become a norm that *doing more* is related to being sincere and indicative of commitment.

What about the goals behind the task itself? What do they indicate? Think about it for a moment.

No matter how motivated, dedicated or sincere you are, if the task has not achieved the goal, its likely the patient is not going to be happy. Patients may not often vocalize, but repeated episodes of this nature will build up frustration in them. And when frustrated, the patient is going to give a *damn* about your efforts.

And so should you. Shed those useless high-flying decorative words you use to describe your half-baked efforts. You should be singularly focused on achieving your goal for the task. For that it is essential that you spend quality time on it. Do not commit *hara-kiri* by committing yourself to more than you can.
